PHP Stock Analyzer
-----
A experimental project to help me learn PHP. The goal is to implement some of the basic financial analysis processes. 

I think I have learned more about configuring Apache2 than PHP so far (8/4/24).
In hindsight, it might have been more useful to use things like Laravel, XAMPP
